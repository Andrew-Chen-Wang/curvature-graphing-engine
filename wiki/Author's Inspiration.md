I created this because of my unreal interest in atronomy with a lack of time
to actually dive deep into it. Something that got me interested was Veritasium's
video on the rarely detected gravitational waves,
[TIMELAPSE OF THE FUTURE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD4izuDMUQA)
for animation inspiration, and my general interest in trying out Rust.

Another thing driving me forward was NASA's lack of funding with reason #5
from Mark Rober's video (it's been awhile since I watched it, so
hopefully #5 was the correct number). I wanted to create an open source space
launch program, like NASA's JPL, or at least something that could be
philanthropically funded to inspire others, kind of like (that one
astronomer who "stole" papers from his "master(?)/employer" and I
can't believe I forgot the guy's name... I thought it was Keppler).
But I really didn't gain much traction with my lack of effort.

I've got a renewed interest after dealing with web apps for awhile...
not that I've done too much frontend development myself. Mostly
my interest in atronomy never really died, and I hope my inspiration
can also spark some in other generations -- yound and old --
who have yet to realize dive into the magnificent rabbit hole that
is astronomy. **It's an amazing expanse of knowledge that greatly
helped me in my journey in programming (really YouTube helped the
most) by lending me ideas that I could translate into solutions
for some of my most complex situations.**

YouTube videos, any like gaming, educational, even Gordon Ramsey
cooking and shouting, can help one learn more and translate
ideas from a concept of one subject to a solution or an idea
of a completely different subject.

That's my joy in life, and I hope this helps others to try
and do the same. No one person is alike, but I've found
this strategy of taking an idea from one place and installing
it in another to be a really cool way of expanding one's creativity.
(e.g. I mentioned CAD. Friend going into biomechanical engineering,
so that's where I got the concept for generating objects from).
