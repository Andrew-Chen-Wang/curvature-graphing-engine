To move around, use the WASD for moving and QE
to look "up" and "down" (to you as an random
astronaunt I guess).

Moving the camera just means moving your mouse;
to escape, press the ESC button to select some
other options. To return to rotating, press
the Rotate button in the menu.

### Photons
It's useful to visualize the curvature "generated"
by gravity using photons instead of the built-in
graph.

Select the photons option on the bottom and left
click and hold down to generate 100 "very luminous"
photons. They're mostly for visuals, but they carry
the same properties of photons... besides its
brightness.
