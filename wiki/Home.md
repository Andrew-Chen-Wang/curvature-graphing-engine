Welcome to the Natural Gravity Engine wiki!

This engine is intended for exploring the curvature of space-time and gravity and its effects based on our current understanding of each phenomenon. This engine's original intention was for exploration and ideation of new concepts by providing a simple GUI for exploring the unknown.

The Space Curvature Engine is intended for thinking deeper about what space-time actually is.

(Note: this was originally called the
space curvature engine, but I realized
this was going to be more of a gravity
engine more than space curvatures.
The curving of space-time is still a
main focus.)
