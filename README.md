Physics engine with 4D graphs that mimics curvatures of space for researching gravitational waves.

### Introduction

This physics engine was designed to understand gravity and the curvature of space.
It allows for creating objects and viewing a graph at the same time that
the generated object bends space-time.

Generating an object begins with a "perfect" sphere with frozen time.
You can also opt to generate an object while time continues. You can think
of it like CAD with layers and objects that can "empty" the insides of a
specified object. An easy option of expanding the initial sphere is to click
the surface area once to create a point which you can expand via
the basic arrow keys. This can also be done with multiple (logical) points
representing a 3D object that can also be used to expand or retract objects
based on your arrow key directions.

The graph that you'll see show how space-time is being bent, assuming we
are using the 4D model of "space." You can enable "random photons" to help
imagine how the curvature works (think of it like a black hole).

To increase the density of an object or access its attributes,
let's say to make a black dwarf, you must click on an object to open
a menu and edit its properties. The option of changing density
supports frozen and unfrozen time. Changing chemical composition
can only be done in frozen time.

This project keeps in mind that plugins can be developed to extend the core
framework. Please view the plugins section for open-source plugins
that have been approved.

Although I'm no astronomer, not even an amateur astronomer, I have a general
interest in this field. If you see a conceptual problem, please open a GitHub
issue. Thank you!

### Plugins

If you have a plugin, open a PR with your plugin's name with link (it must be
open source to be considered on this list. [Inspiration](https://youtu.be/95Tc0Rk2cNg?t=260)).

### Author's Inspiration

I created this because of my unreal interest in atronomy with a lack of time
to actually dive deep into it. Something that got me interested was Veritasium's
video on the rarely detected gravitational waves,
[TIMELAPSE OF THE FUTURE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD4izuDMUQA)
for animation inspiration, and my general interest in trying out Rust.

Another thing driving me forward was NASA's lack of funding with reason
#5 from Mark Rober's video (it's been awhile since I watched it, so
hopefully #5 was the correct number). I wanted to create an open source space
launch program, like NASA's JPL, or at least something that could be
philanthropically funded to inspire others, kind of like (that one
astronomer who "stole" papers from his "master(?)/employer" and I
can't believe I forgot the guy's name... I thought it was Keppler).
But I really didn't gain much traction with my lack of effort.

I've got a renewed interest after dealing with web apps for awhile...
not that I've done too much frontend development myself. Mostly
my interest in atronomy never really died, and I hope my inspiration
can also spark some in other generations -- yound and old --
who have yet to realize dive into the magnificent rabbit hole that
is astronomy. **It's an amazing expanse of knowledge that greatly
helped me in my journey in programming (really YouTube helped the
most) by lending me ideas that I could translate into solutions
for some of my most complex situations.**

YouTube videos, any like gaming, educational, even Gordon Ramsey
cooking and shouting, can help one learn more and translate
ideas from a concept of one subject to a solution or an idea
of a completely different subject.

That's my joy in life, and I hope this helps others to try
and do the same. No one person is alike, but I've found
this strategy of taking an idea from one place and installing
it in another to be a really cool way of expanding one's creativity.
(e.g. I mentioned CAD. Friend going into biomechanical engineering,
so that's where I got the concept for generating objects from).
